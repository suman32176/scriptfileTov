Did you know, guys, that dreams are more mysterious than we think? For instance, everyone dreams every night, even if we don’t remember them, and we only dream about faces we’ve seen before, even if they’re strangers in the dream. Surprisingly, most of our dreams are negative, involving themes of anxiety, failure, or danger, yet they help us process emotions and make sense of our daily experiences. While some people dream in black and white, others dream in vivid colors, and some can even control their dreams through a technique called lucid dreaming. Also, you’re more likely to remember your dream if you wake up during it—so the next time you wake up in the middle of the night, try jotting it down!
